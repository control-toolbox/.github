# Welcome to control-toolbox ecosystem!

The control-toolbox ecosystem regroups `Julia` packages. The root package is [OptimalControl.jl](https://github.com/control-toolbox/OptimalControl.jl) which aims to provide tools to solve optimal control problems by direct and indirect methods. The packages [PathFollowing.jl](https://github.com/control-toolbox/PathFollowing.jl) and [HamiltonianFlows.jl](https://github.com/control-toolbox/HamiltonianFlows.jl) are independent and provide respectively path following methods and flows from Hamiltonian functions and systems. See the documentations:

The [setup](https://github.com/orgs/control-toolbox/repositories?type=all) of the control-toolbox ecosystem is the following:

* [ct-registry](https://github.com/control-toolbox/ct-registryb): the control-toolbox registry since the packages are not yet available in the [official registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General).
* [CTBase.jl](https://github.com/control-toolbox/CTBase.jl): fundamentals of the control-toolbox ecosystem
* [CTDirect.jl](https://github.com/control-toolbox/CTDirect.jl): direct transcription of an optimal control problem and resolution
* [CTDirectShooting.jl](https://github.com/control-toolbox/CTDirectShooting.jl): direct shooting transcription of an optimal control problem and resolution
* [CTProblemLibrary.jl](https://github.com/control-toolbox/CTProblemLibrary.jl): library of optimal control problems from the control-toolbox ecosystem 
* [HamiltonianFlows.jl](https://github.com/control-toolbox/HamiltonianFlows.jl): Hamiltonian flows
* [OptimalControl.jl](https://github.com/control-toolbox/OptimalControl.jl): main root package.
* [PathFollowing.jl](https://github.com/control-toolbox/PathFollowing.jl): path following methods
