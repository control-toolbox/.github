# Welcome to the control-toolbox ecosystem!

The control-toolbox ecosystem gathers `Julia` packages for mathematical control and applications. It is an outcome of a research initiative supported by the [Centre Inria of Université Côte d'Azur](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-universite-cote-azur) and a sequel to previous developments, notably [Bocop](https://www.bocop.org) and [Hampath](https://www.hampath.org). See also: [ct gallery](https://ct.gitlabpages.inria.fr/gallery). The root package is [OptimalControl.jl](https://github.com/control-toolbox/OptimalControl.jl) which aims to provide tools to solve optimal control problems by direct and indirect methods.

An optimal control problem can be described as minimising the cost functional

```math
{\large
g(t_0, x(t_0), t_f, x(t_f)) + \int_{t_0}^{t_f} f^{0}(t, x(t), u(t))~\mathrm{d}t
}
```

where the state $\large{x}$ and the control $\large{u}$ are functions subject, for $\large{t \in [t_0, t_f]}$,
to the differential constraint

```math
{\large
   \dot{x}(t) = f(t, x(t), u(t))
}
```

and other constraints such as

```math
{\large
\begin{array}{llcll}
~\xi_l  &\le& \xi(t, u(t))        &\le& \xi_u, \\
\psi_l &\le& \psi(t, x(t), u(t)) &\le& \psi_u, \\
\eta_l &\le& \eta(t, x(t))       &\le& \eta_u, \\
\phi_l &\le& \phi(t_0, x(t_0), t_f, x(t_f)) &\le& \phi_u.
\end{array}
}
```

## Installation

To install a package from the control-toolbox ecosystem, you must add its registry into your `Julia` configuration.

Start `Julia`:

```shell
>> julia

   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.8.2 (2022-09-29)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |
```

Then, add `ct-registry` to the list of known registries:

```shell
julia> ]
pkg> registry add https://github.com/control-toolbox/ct-registry.git
```

Finally, you can install any package as usual. For instance:

```shell
pkg> add OptimalControl
```
